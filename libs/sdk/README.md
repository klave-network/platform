# Klave SDK

The Klave SDK is a powerful toolset designed to facilitate the development of honest applications on the Klave platform. It provides developers with the necessary resources to create, deploy, and manage applications that leverage Klave's secure and decentralized infrastructure.

## Features

- **Application Scaffolding**: Quickly set up new applications with predefined templates and structures.
- **Ledger Integration**: Utilize a robust tamperproof ledger for efficient secure data storage and retrieval.
- **Subscriptions and Notifications**: Implement real-time query monitoring and event-driven automation within your applications.
- **Secure Communications**: Ensure encrypted interactions between end-user devices and Klave nodes.
- **Cryptographic Support**: Access built-in cryptographic functions for secure computations and data integrity.
- **Web Interactions**: Integrate with external web services via HTTPS, enabling functionalities like API calls and email dispatch.
- **Cross-Application and Cross-Cluster Communications**: Facilitate seamless interactions between different applications and clusters within the Klave ecosystem.
- **Branching and Transaction Management**: Manage complex transaction workflows, including nested transactions and conditional operations.
- **AI Integration**: Leverage support for AI model inference, with plans to include model training capabilities in the future.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Klave SDK, ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >=24
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

You will need a [Klave](https://klave.com) account to deploy your application using this SDK

```

## Getting Started

It is recommended to obtain this SDK by using the `create-on-klave` tool to scaffold a fonctioning honest appliation right away

```bash
